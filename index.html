                Abu Isma'il Muhammad bin Isma'il Salmi said: "When I prayed behind Abu Nu'man Muhammad bin Fadl, he did
                rifa'idin when he started the prayer. When I asked him about this, he said: "I prayed in the presence of
                Hammad bin Zaid. When he started the prayer and went to ruku and when he got up from ruku, I asked him
                about
                it, and he said that I prayed behind Ayyub Qadirani, he also used to do rifaydin while starting the
                prayer
                and going to ruku and getting up from ruku. When I asked him, he said: "I saw Ata bin Abi Rabbah who
                used to
                perform rifa'idin while starting the prayer and going to ruku and getting up from ruku." When I asked
                him,
                he said: "I prayed behind 'Abd Allah b. Al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him), and when he started
                praying and when he bowed his head, he used to do rifa'idin." When I asked him about this, Abdullah bin
                Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I prayed behind Sayyidna Abu Bakr Siddique (RA). He also
                used
                to bow his head at the beginning of prayer and when going into ruku and when rising from ruku and Abu
                Bakr
                Siddique (ra) says that I prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
                him).
                He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to bow when he started the prayer, and when he bowed,
                and
                when he raised his head from bowing, he bowed. The narrators of this hadith are trustworthy. </p>

                (catching each other).

                When he was about to bow, he raised them in the same manner. He then placed his hands on his knees. When
                he raised his head after bowing, he raised them in the like manner. When he prostrated himself he placed
                his forehead between his hands.

                He then sat down and spread his left foot and placed his left hand on his left thigh, and kept his right
                elbow aloof from his right thigh. He closed his two fingers and made a circle (with the fingers). I
                (Asim ibn Kulayb) saw him (Bishr ibn al-Mufaddal) say in this manner. Bishr made the circle with the

            <h2>Second Answer:</h2>
            <p>There is no mention of the rafa yadain of ruku’ in this narration of Sufyan ath-Thawri, therefore, this
                narration is general.</p><br>
            <p>If it is considered general then even the opposers of rafa yadain do not follow this Hadith. They raise
                their hands in Witr after the first Takbeer (while this hadith only says to raise the hands in the first
                takbeer). They raise their hands after the first takbeer in the prayers of Eidain. If the exception of
                Witr and Eidain is proven from other ahadith, then the exception of rafa yadain before and after ruku’
                is also proven from other ahadith.

            </p><br>
            <p>It is essential for those who take evidence from this hadith, that first they try to save the rafa yadain
                of witr and eidain from the generality of this hadith.

            </p>
            <h3><b>NOTE:</b>The opposition of the rafa yadain of before and after ruku is not proven from any Sahih
                hadith. The ahadith of the opposers are Baatil, Da’eef, and Mardood. [For more details see the book of
                Hafidh Ibn al-Qayyim, Manar al-Maneef pg 137]</h3>
            <hr>
            <h2>Third Answer:</h2>
            <p>As it is stated above, that this hadith doesn’t mention about the rafa yadain of before and after ruku,
                Imam Abu Dawud has brought this hadith under the chapter heading:</p><br>

            <p>(Chapter of those who did not mention about the rafa yadain in ruku) “بَاب مَنْ لَمْ يَذْكُرِ الرَّفْعَ
                عِنْدَ الرُّكُوعِ”</p>
            <p>And it is known even to common students that, (after mentioning the proof of a thing) mentioning of
                anything afterwards, is not a proof of the prohibition of what is mentioned before.</p>

            <div class="hadith">Ibn al-Tarkamani Hanafi said: “The one who does not mention about a thing is not a
                Hujjah on one who mentions it.” [Al-Johar al-Naqi Vol 4, Pg 317]</div>

            <p> The famous Muhaddith Hafidh Ibn Hajr al-Asqalani said: </p>


            <div class="hadith"> [Al-Darayah Vol 1, Pg 225] “ولا یلزم من عدم ذکر الشئ عدم وقوعہ”

                Therefore, even with this aformementioned Da’eef hadith of Sufyan ath-Thawri, the opposition of rafa
                yadain
                does not get proven. </div>

            <h2>Fourth Answer:</h2>





            <p>There is negation in the Hadith of Sufyan, while in the Mutawaatir ahadith of Sahihain, there is
                confirmation, and it is known even to ordinary students that confirmation is precedent over negation.
            </p>


            <p> Imam Nawawi said: Acting upon the (sahih) ahadith of rafa yadain is superior, because they contain the
                confirmation, while this (the hadith of Sufyan) is negation. Thus confirmation will take precedence over
                negation due to it being excessive in knowledge.</p>
            <div class="hadith"> [Al-Majmoo’ Sharh Madhab 403/3] </div>


            <p>Hanafis say that even Karkhi Hanafi (d. 317) has declared the confirmation (of something) to be superior
                to
                the negation, to act upon. </p>
            <div class="hadith">[See: Noor ul-Anwaar: Pg 197],
                For more details see: Nasb ur-Rayaa (359/1), and Fathul Bari (333/1) </div>
            <hr>
            <h2>Fifth Answer</h2>

            <p> Some scholars have said that this hadith means that Ibn Mas’ood raised his hands only once with the
                First
                Takbeer, not again and again. (Meaning the rafa yadain of first takbeer was done only once by him). </p>


            <div class="hadith"> [See: Mishkaat al-Masaabih Pg 77, H. 809] </div>

            <p>Imam Nawawi said: Our companions have said that if this hadith was authentic, then its meaning would be
                that, he did not used to do rafa yadain again and again, in the beginning of the prayer and in the
                beginning
                of other rakahs. (It does not have to do anything with the rafa yadain of ruku), from this Ta’weel, all
                the
                ahadeeth will be followed.</p>

            <h2>Sixth Answer</h2>

            <p> Even if this Hadith, for the sake of argument, were to be authentic, then still it would be considered
                abrogated (Mansookh). </p>


            <p> Imam Ahmed bin Al-Husain al-Baihaqi said: It’s possible that in the beginning, Tark-e-Rafa Yadain was
                present when the permissiblity of rafa yadain was not there, and after that it got abrogated, and the
                rafa
                yadain of before and after ruku’ became the sunnah, and these two things remained the same with Ibn
                Mas’ood. </p>


            <div class="hadith"> [Ma’rifat al-Sunan wal Athaar Vol 1, Pg 220] </div>




            <h2><b> Note: </b> This is a retaliatory (Ilzaami) answer; otherwise the reality is that this hadith is not
                proven from
                Ibn Mas’ood.</h2>
            <hr>
            <h2> Lastly: </h2>


            <p> Hafidh Ibn Hazam writes about this Hadith of Ibn Mas’ood that: If this hadith was not there, then the
                rafa
                yadain would have been obligatory with every bending, rising, Takbeer, and Tamheed. </p>
            <div class="hadith"> [Al-Muhalla Vol 4, 88] </div>


            <p> In the light of the above details, the hadith of Ibn Mas’ood presented by Ibn Hazam, due to several
                defects,
                is proven to be Da’eef. </p>


            <p> Therefore, let the people decide (who use his saying against this hadith) , what is the position of rafa
                yadain according to Ibn Hazam? Doesn’t it become obligatory according to him? </p>


            <div class="hadith"> And Allah Knows The Best. </div>

            <div class="hadith">I have proved the hadith of Ibn Masood Da'if and Imam Abu Hanifa Said: the sahih hadith
